## Finding the best hospital in a state
## 

# Write a function called best that take two arguments: the 2-character
# abbreviated name of a state and an outcome name. 

# The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a
# character vector with the name of the hospital that has the best (i.e. lowest)
# 30-day mortality for the specified outcome in that state.

# The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. 

# The outcomes can be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”. 
# Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded
# from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.

# Handling ties. If there is a tie for the best hospital
# for a given outcome, then the hospital names should be sorted in alphabetical
# order and the first hospital in that set should be chosen (i.e. if hospitals
# “b”, “c”, and “f” are tied for best, then hospital “b” should be returned). 

# The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid state value
# is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function
# with the exact message “invalid state”. If an invalid outcome value is passed
# to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the
# exact message “invalid outcome”.
